Tasks for 0x17-doubly_linked_lists
====

### Learned about Doubly Linked List(DLL).

__Uses Of DLL__:
 - It is used in the navigation systems where front and back navigation is required. Eg. browsers.
 - It is also used by various applications to implement undo and redo functionality.

__Pros__:
 - Deletion of nodes is easy as compared to a Singly Linked List. A singly linked list deletion requires a pointer to the node and previous node to be deleted but in the doubly linked list, it only required the pointer which is to be deleted.

__Tasks__
1. _Print list_. Write a function that prints all the elements of a dlistint_t list.
2. _List length_. Write a function that returns the number of elements in a linked dlistint_t list.
3. _Add node_. Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a dlistint_t list.
4. _Add node at the end_. Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a dlistint_t list.
5. _Free list_. Write a function that frees a dlistint_t list.
6. _Get node at index_. Write a function that returns the nth node of a dlistint_t linked list.
7. _Sum list_. Write a function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a dlistint_t linked list.
8. _Insert at index_. Write a function that inserts a new node at a given position.
9. _Delete at index_. Write a function that deletes the node at index index of a dlistint_t linked list.
10. _Crackme4_. Find the password for [crackme4](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x17.c).
11. _Palindromes_. A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99. Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers. Save the result in the file 102-result, Your file should contain the exact result, no new line, no extra space.
12. _crackme5_. Write a keygen for [crackme5](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x17.c). Usage of the crackme: ./crackme5 username key The crackme will segfault if you do not enter the correct key for the user, Usage for your keygen: ./keygen5 username, Your keygen should print a valid key for the username
